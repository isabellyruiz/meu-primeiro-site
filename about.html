      Every increase in global warming matters
    </h3>

    <p style="margin: 20px; font-size: 20px">
      In a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government
      reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than
      1.5°C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a livable
      climate. Yet policies currently in place point to a 2.8°C temperature rise
      by the end of the century. The emissions that cause climate change come
      from every part of the world and affect everyone, but some countries
      produce much more than others. The 100 least-emitting countries generate 3
      per cent of total emissions. The 10 countries with the largest emissions
      contribute 68 per cent. Everyone must take climate action, but people and
      countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to
      act first
